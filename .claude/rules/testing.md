# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Check test isolation
2. Verify mocks are correct
3. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

Prefer Arrange-Act-Assert structure for tests:

```javascript
test('calculates similarity correctly', () => {
  // Arrange
  const vector1 = [1, 0, 0]
  const vector2 = [0, 1, 0]

  // Act
  const similarity = calculateCosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2)

  // Assert
  expect(similarity).toBe(0)
})
```

### Test Naming

Use descriptive names that explain the behavior under test:

```javascript
test('returns empty array when no markets match query', () => {})
test('throws error when API key is missing', () => {})
test('falls back to substring search when cache is unavailable', () => {})
```

### Test Data

Don't hardcode test data in the test itself unless it is trivial.

Store complex test data in separate fixtures or use factory functions to generate it. This keeps tests clean and focused on behavior rather than setup.
